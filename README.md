# ARCH_Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles (usually in ~/ | ~/.config) that I deploy on most of my Arch-Linux based systems.

### .bashrc
My personal bash configuration, including a custom prompt and alias declaration for various commands. Be aware, that some aliases rely on my custom scripts to be installed in ~/exe/. See my ARCH_Scripts repository for more information.

### .Xresources
Currently my Xresources file only contains settings for my preffered terminal emulator URXVT.

### .mozilla/firefox
This directory contains my firefox configuration, based on the [CustomCSSforFx Repository](https://github.com/Aris-t2) by GitHub user [Aris-T2](https://github.com/Aris-t2)
